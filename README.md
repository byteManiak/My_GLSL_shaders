# Collection of GLSL shaders
This is my personal collection of GLSL shaders I've written. All shaders have been made using [glslsandbox.com](http://glslsandbox.com).

- ```graph.glsl``` - This is a simple graph plotter shader. You can change the graph function in the body of the ```float f(float x)``` function.
