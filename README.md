# Collection of GLSL shaders
This is my personal collection of GLSL shaders I've written. All shaders have been made using [glslsandbox.com](http://glslsandbox.com).

- ```graph.glsl``` - This is a simple graph plotter shader. You can change the graph function in the body of the ```float f(float x)``` function.
- ```core.glsl``` - A pulsating "power core" reflecting light over two "oceans". Note that graphical glitches might occur depending on the platform used to view the shader.
- ```rotozoomer.glsl``` - A simple rotozoomer effect.
- ```pulse.glsl``` - A grid lit by pulsating light.
